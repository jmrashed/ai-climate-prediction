# AI Climate Prediction

This project leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict climate-related outcomes, such as temperature changes, precipitation patterns, and other environmental factors. It aims to provide valuable insights for climate science, environmental monitoring, and policy-making.

## Overview

The **AI Climate Prediction** project focuses on building predictive models using historical climate data and AI to forecast future climate trends. The project applies various machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets, predict climate variables, and visualize the results to make predictions that can help inform sustainable solutions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter (for running notebooks)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Conda (optional, if you prefer using conda environments)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmrashed/ai-climate-prediction.git
cd ai-climate-prediction
```

#### Using `pip`:

Install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using `conda`:

Alternatively, you can create a Conda environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai-climate-prediction
```

### Running the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Preprocess the data using the script or by running the relevant Jupyter notebook under `notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis/`.

2. **Training the Model**:
   You can train the model using the script `scripts/train_model.py` or by running the relevant notebook in `notebooks/model_training/`.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   After training, evaluate the model using `scripts/evaluate_model.py`.

4. **Making Predictions**:
   Once the model is trained and evaluated, use `scripts/generate_predictions.py` to generate predictions.

### Docker Usage

To containerize the project and run it inside a Docker container, use the following commands:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-climate-prediction .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it ai-climate-prediction
   ```

### Running Tests

To run tests for the project, use `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
